# Group Project - Anything's Fine

Anything's Fine is a recommendation and social media app for food.  People often do not know what to eat, so they can use this app to
get a recipe, restaurant, snack, or food recommendation.  They can also view the social media page of the app to see what their friends are eating.
Everyone has to eat so there is sure to be plenty of opportunity to use Anything's Fine.  Creativity can be expressed as users can share their
favorite recipes and take fun photos of their food creations.
